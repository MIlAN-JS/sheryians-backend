rule#1 : feature deciding ---> backend creation 




user data = {
  user_name 
  user_email, 
  user_password, 
  user_bio 
  user_imgae
  followers : []
  following : []
}


post : {
  caption : "",
  img_Link : "",  // file handelling --
  userId :   , // 
}









followers : 
following :   --->   we cannot store them in users schema like users : {
                                                                    following : 
                                                                    type : objectId
                                                                    ref : user

                                                                            } because if there are millions of followers then it requires high amount of storage and network


so we use

edge collection (a collection where realtion between 2 documents are stored like , realtion between post and like , post and comment , follower and following etc )



how do we use it ( we create a new collection for this )
